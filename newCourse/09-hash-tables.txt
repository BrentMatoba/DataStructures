What is a hash table?
     A hash table (HT) is a data strucutre that provides a mapping from keys to values using 
     a technique called hashing. (ALSO CALLED DICTIONARY)
     Key value pairs, keys must be unique, but values can be repeated.
     
     HTs are often used to track item frequencies. For instance, counting the number of times a 
     word appears in a given text.
