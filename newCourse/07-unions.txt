    1.1 What is a Union Find?
        A Union Find is a data structure that keeps track of elements which are split into one or 
        more disjoint sets. It has two primary operations, find() and union()

    CHATGPT because I am confused: 
    Union Find is a data structure used to keep track of elements divided into groups or sets. It's 
    really good at two things: combining groups together and finding out which group a particular
    element belongs to. Imagine you have lots of islands, and you want to connect them with bridges
    . Union Find helps you keep track of which islands are connected. So, whenever you want to 
    connect two islands (or elements), you use the "union" part. And when you want to check if two
    islands are already connected, you use the "find" part. It's like a quick way to manage and 
    check connections between things.
