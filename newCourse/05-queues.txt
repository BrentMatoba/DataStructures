1. Discussion
    1.1 What is a queue.
        A queue is a linear data strucutre which models real world queuees by having two primary operations.
        Namely, enqueue and dequeue.

    1.2 Terminology
        There does not seem to be cnsistent Terminology for inserting and removing elemetns from queues.
        Enqueue == Adding == Offering
            ADDING AN ITEM TO THE Queue
        Dequeue == polling == removing.
    1.3 When and where is a queue used?
        Any waiting line models a queue, for example, a lineup at a movie theater.
        Can be used to effeciently keep track of the x most recently added elements.
        Web server request management where you want first come first serve.
        Breadth first search (BFS) graph traversal.
