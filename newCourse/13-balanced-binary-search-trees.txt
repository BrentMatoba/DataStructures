What is a balanced binary search tree?
A balanced binary search tree is a self-balancing binary search tree.
This type of tree will adjust itself in order to maintain a low(logarithmic) height allowing for
faster operations such as insertion and deletion.

Time Complexity
Copmlexity of Binary search trees
Insert, Average:O(log(n)) Worst: O(n)
Delete, Average:O(log(n)) Worst: O(n)
Remove, Average:O(log(n)) Worst: O(n)
Search, Average:O(log(n)) Worst: O(n)

Insert, Average: O(log(n)), Worst: O(log(n))
Delete, Average: O(log(n)), Worst: O(log(n))
Remove, Average: O(log(n)), Worst: O(log(n))
Search, Average: O(log(n)), Worst: O(log(n))
