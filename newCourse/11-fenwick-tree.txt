Fenwick Tree (also called Binary Indexed Tree)
Effecient and very simple to code.

Outline
    1. Discussion and Examples
        1.1 Data Structure motivation.
        1.2 What is a Fenwick Tree?
        1.3 Complexity Analysis
    2. Implementation Details
        2.1 Range Query
        2.2 Point Updates
        2.3 Fenwick Tree Construction
    3. Code Implementation


Data Strucutre Motivation:
    Given an array of integer values, compute the range sum between index[i, j)
    5 -3 6 1 0 -4 11 6 2 7
        If you were to add all of these intuitively, you get linear time, (BAD)
    If you use a fenwick tree and calculate prefix sums, you get constant time (VERY GOOD)
