What is a suffix?
A suffix is a substring at the enod of a string of characters. For our purposes, suffixes are non empty.

For instsance, the word HORSE has five different suffixs.
    E
    SE
    RSE
    ORSE
    HORSE
        *entire word is counted as a variation


A suffix Array is an array which contains ALL the sorted suffixes of a string.
What could the possible use case be?

For Example, the suffix array of "camel" is
    0:Camel             1: amel
    1:Amel              0: camel
    2:mel      ->       3: el
    3:el                4: l
    4:l                 2: mel

The actual "suffix array" is the array of sorted indices, the numbers themselves.
This provides a compressed representation of the sorted needing to store the suffixes.

The suffix array provides a space efficient alternative to a suffix tree which itself is a compressed version of a trie.
    note: suffix arrays cand o everything suffix trees can, with some additional information such as a longest common prefix (LCP) array




The longest common prefix array. (LCP)
What is an LCP array?
The LCP array is an array in which every index tracks how many characters two sorted adjacent suffixes have in common.
By convention, LCP[0] is undefined, but for most purposes it's fine to set it to zero.
NOTE: These exists many methods for efficiently construciton the LCP array in O(log(N)) and O(n) we will cover one or more of these in a future video.


USING SA/LCP array to find unique substrings
    Fidning Unique substrings
        The problem of finding/counting all the unique substrings of a string is a commonplace problem in computer science.
        The naive algorithm generates all substrings and places them in a set resulting in a O(n^2) algorithm.
        A better approach is using the LCP array. This provides not only a quick but also a space efficient solution.
