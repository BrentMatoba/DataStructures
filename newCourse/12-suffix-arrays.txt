A suffix Array is an array which contains ALL the sorted suffixes of a string.
What could the possible use case be?

For Example, the suffix array of "camel" is
    0:Camel             1: amel
    1:Amel              0: camel
    2:mel      ->       3: el
    3:el                4: l
    4:l                 2: mel
