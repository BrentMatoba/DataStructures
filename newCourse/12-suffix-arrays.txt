What is a suffix?
A suffix is a substring at the enod of a string of characters. For our purposes, suffixes are non empty.

For instsance, the word HORSE has five different suffixs.
    E
    SE
    RSE
    ORSE
    HORSE
        *entire word is counted as a variation


A suffix Array is an array which contains ALL the sorted suffixes of a string.
What could the possible use case be?

For Example, the suffix array of "camel" is
    0:Camel             1: amel
    1:Amel              0: camel
    2:mel      ->       3: el
    3:el                4: l
    4:l                 2: mel

The actual "suffix array" is the array of sorted indices, the numbers themselves.
This provides a compressed representation of the sorted needing to store the suffixes.

The suffix array provides a space efficient alternative to a suffix tree which itself is a compressed version of a trie.
    note: suffix arrays cand o everything suffix trees can, with some additional information such as a longest common prefix (LCP) array
