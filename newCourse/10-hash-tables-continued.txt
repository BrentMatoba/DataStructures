Hash Table Double Hashing
    Open Addressing main idea
    General insertion method for open addressing on a table of size N goes:
    x = 1
    keyHash = H1(k) mod nindex = keyHash
    
    while table[inx] != null
        index = (keyhash + P(k,x)) mod N
        x = x+1

    insert (k,v) at table[index]

    Where Hx(k) is the hash for the key k and P(k,x) is the probing function
