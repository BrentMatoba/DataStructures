Hash Table Double Hashing
    Open Addressing main idea
    General insertion method for open addressing on a table of size N goes:
    x = 1
    keyHash = H1(k) mod nindex = keyHash
    
    while table[inx] != null
        index = (keyhash + P(k,x)) mod N
        x = x+1

    insert (k,v) at table[index]

    Where Hx(k) is the hash for the key k and P(k,x) is the probing function



What is double hashing?
    Double hashing is a probing method which probes according to a constant multiple ofanother hash
    fucntion, specifically:
    P(k,x) = x*H2(k) where H2(k) is a second hash function
    H2(k) must hash the same type of keys as H1(k)
        NOTE: Notice that doubling hashing reduces to linear probing (except that the constant is unknown until runtime)
    

Chaos with cycles 
    Since double hashing reduces to linear probing at runtime, we may end up with a linear probing function such as 
    P(x) =  3x, H1(k) = 4, and table size is N=9.
    In this case, we end up witht he following cycle occuring
    H(K) + P(0) mod N = 4
    H(K) + P(1) mod N = 7
    H(K) + P(2) mod N = 1
    H(K) + P(3) mod N = 4
    H(K) + P(4) mod N = 7
    H(K) + P(5) mod N = 1
    H(K) + P(6) mod N = 4
    H(K) + P(7) mod N = 7
    H(K) + P(8) mod N = 1


Chaos with cycles
    To fix the issue of cycles pick the table size to be a prime number and also compute the value of 

Constructing H2(k)'
    Suppose the k has type t

    Whenever we want to use double hashing as a collision resolution method we need to fabricate a new functionH2(k)
    that knowns how to hash  keys of type T.

    It would be nice to have a systematic way to be able to effectively produce a new hash function every time we need one.
    Luckily for us, the keys we need to hash are always composed of the same fundamental building blocks. IN particular: integers, strings, real numbers, fixed length vectors, etc...

    There are many well known high quality hash functions for these fundam;ental data types. Hence, we can use and combine them to construct our fucntion H2(k)
    Frequently, the hash functions selected toc ompose H2(k) are picked from a pool of hash functions called universal hash functions
    which generally operate on one fundamental data type.

Inserting with double hashing 
    Suppose we have an originally empty hash table anbd we want ot insert some (ki,vi) pairs iwth Double hashing and we selected our hash table to have
    Probing function: P(x) = x*H2(k)
    Table size: N=7 (A prime number)
    max load fact or: Alpha = 0.75
    threshold before resize = N * a = 5
