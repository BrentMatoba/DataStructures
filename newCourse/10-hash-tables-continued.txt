Hash Table Double Hashing
    Open Addressing main idea
    General insertion method for open addressing on a table of size N goes:
    x = 1
    keyHash = H1(k) mod nindex = keyHash
    
    while table[inx] != null
        index = (keyhash + P(k,x)) mod N
        x = x+1

    insert (k,v) at table[index]

    Where Hx(k) is the hash for the key k and P(k,x) is the probing function



What is double hashing?
    Double hashing is a probing method which probes according to a constant multiple ofanother hash
    fucntion, specifically:
    P(k,x) = x*H2(k) where H2(k) is a second hash function
    H2(k) must hash the same type of keys as H1(k)
        NOTE: Notice that doubling hashing reduces to linear probing (except that the constant is unknown until runtime)
