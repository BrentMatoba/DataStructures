1. What is a data structure?
A data structure (DS) is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively/effeciently.

Why data structures?
They are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms. They help to manage and organize data.
They make code cleaner and easier to understand.
    Programmers who excel are ones that know how an when to use appropriate data structures.

Abstract Data Types:
    An abstract data type(ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure
    must adhere to.
    The intereface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.

    A metaphor:
        Suppose the ADT is a mode of transportation, to get from point A to point B. There many forms available, like walking, or biking.
        These specific modes of transportation are analagous to the data structures themselves.

        Data structures are the concrete realizations of the abstract concepts defined by ADT's.

        Examples
        Abstraction:Implenmentation.
        List:Dynamic Array/Linked List
        Queue: LinkedList based queue/Array based Queue/Stack based queue
        Map: Tree map/HashMap/Hashtable
        Vehicle: GolfCart/Bicycle/Smart Car
